# button-blink
A simple program to cycle through the LEDs upon each press of the user push button on the STM32F407-DISC1 development board.

### Purpose
The intention of this project was to:
1. Configure and test an input GPIO.
2. Use that input GPIO to trigger and interrupt.
3. Write a custom interrupt handler for the input pin's interrupt.
